## Hi!

<img style="float: right; max-width: 20%;" src="/assets/portrait.jpg">

My name is Melvin Suter, I'm a System Engineer from Switzerland that started is journey through the IT world in 2011 with an apprenticeship. From there I switched jobs to get a position as a consultant and help out other IT departments. Currently my main focus is Linux and Infrastructure. That includes basic maintenance of Linux and infrastructure-systems as well as implement infrastructure projects and developing new products based on Linux and Open Source applications.

In my spare time I like to code stuff, work with my 3D printer and build on my homelab. As a typical IT nerd, I obviously like to play games too. A relatively new hobby I've picked up is photography. Landscape and macro photography I really enjoy, but also abstract and animal subjects are a lot of fun. Still finding my place in the big world of photos. :-)

If you have questions or want to have a chat, feel free to reach out to me: contact@&lt;thedomainyouareon&gt;
