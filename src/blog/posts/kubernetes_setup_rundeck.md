To install rundeck on kubernetes, you can use the ressource files from my repository: https://github.com/melvin-suter/rundeck-kubernetes

> This will also deploy a pod for creating a inventory from a vcenter.

Sadly rundeck is incapable of producing a functioning image. So I had to remaster it. For the sole reason that WinRM (which comes preinstalled) needs python and even tho people asked for that in github issues, rundeck has yet to install it into the image. **Sad, really**

Things we need to do after the installation:

- Create Projects
- Create Node Source from the file generated by the inventory runner
- Add a new SSH Key
- Setup WinRM & Stuff
